These documents are in French as this is a class project I worked on in my second year of engineering school.  

I submitted this idea to my class before it started and the teacher approved it.
The project was to develop an energy efficient soda can compacting machine. The device would allow user to workout while the mechanical energy of their effort was put to good use. 

I led my team to perform mechanical studies on soda cans and design a primitive 3D version of the gym bike. 

I also went as far as estimating the number of soda cans are university consumed each year and how much space it took to store them before throwing them away. We do not recycle them 
unfortunately. This system would have allowed us to store many more before recycling.
